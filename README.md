#### Remix Image Component with custom optimizers for Cloudflare

A responsive image component and custom loaders for on-demand optimizing of images. The component has been built with [remix](https://remix.run/) in mind, but can be used in any project. The primary focus of this project is to provide an easy integration with Cloudflare workers.
